This project, titled "Product Mix Optimization Using Linear Programming," was undertaken as part of the CodTech Data Science Internship Task 4. The goal was to solve a real-world business problem using mathematical optimization techniques with Python, specifically utilizing the PuLP library. The project models a scenario where a company must decide how many units of various products to produce to maximize profit, while staying within resource limitations. It demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can significantly improve operational efficiency and profitability.

The business problem involves a manufacturing company producing four products: A, B, C, and D. Each product has different profit margins and requires different amounts of labor hours and raw materials. However, the company has limited resources—150 labor hours and 140 kilograms of raw material. The objective is to determine the optimal number of units of each product to produce to maximize total profit, without exceeding these constraints. This scenario is modeled as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, which is ideal for situations involving continuous variables, a linear objective function, and linear constraints.

The solution begins by defining the decision variables (units of each product), the objective function (maximize total profit), and the constraints (labor and material availability). The problem is then formulated in Python using the PuLP library. The model is solved to determine the most profitable combination of products. Initial results showed that only two of the four products were chosen for production, highlighting the model's ability to prioritize high-margin and resource-efficient options.

To deepen the analysis, two advanced variations were explored. First, a What-If Analysis was conducted by increasing the available labor hours from 150 to 200. This scenario showed that additional resources led to increased profit and changed the optimal production plan, with more products included and in larger quantities. This helped demonstrate the sensitivity of the optimization model to resource availability, reinforcing the importance of strategic resource planning.

Second, a business rule constraint was introduced: each product must have at least 5 units produced. This reflects real-world situations where companies may be required to maintain a certain level of product visibility, branding, or contractual obligations even if some products are less profitable. The model was re-solved with this constraint, and as expected, total profit decreased slightly. However, the inclusion of all products in the production plan shows a realistic trade-off between profitability and business rules.

Multiple visualizations were added to enhance the clarity of results. Bar plots and line charts compared production quantities and profit values across scenarios. These visualizations helped illustrate how different constraints and conditions affected the decision outcomes, making the analysis easy to interpret for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

This project is useful in any industry where production, resource allocation, and profit optimization are involved — such as manufacturing, logistics, supply chain management, and operations planning. It shows how simple mathematical modeling and Python-based optimization can yield significant business insights. It also demonstrates the power of scenario planning and how companies can use optimization models to evaluate the impact of changing resource levels or business policies.

In conclusion, this project not only fulfills the internship requirement to demonstrate problem-solving using optimization and PuLP, but it also goes beyond by adding real-world flexibility, visual storytelling, and business-oriented insights. It’s a strong example of how data science tools can be practically applied to drive smarter decisions and measurable impact.
